# 👋 Hi, I’m Drac (Muhsin)

I’m a **student, designer, and developer** living at the intersection of **logic and aesthetics**.  
I don’t just write code; I try to **craft experiences** — whether that’s scaring players in a horror game or simplifying bureaucracy with a service portal.

I break things to see how they work, then rebuild them better (usually).

## ⚡ Currently Cooking (Active Projects)

- 👻 **Lullaby Down Below (Redux)**  
  Porting my team’s Java Swing horror/survival game into Unity.  
  Working on better player controllers, lighting, and *“accidentally”* making it scarier.

## 🌱 Philosophy

- **Design First**  
  A game isn’t fun if the UI fights you.

- **Iteration**  
  My first draft is always ugly.  
  The third one is usually okay.

- **Teamwork**  
  Code is better when you have people like **Shibili** and **Saivivek** to break it for you.
